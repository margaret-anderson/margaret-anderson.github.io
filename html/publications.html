    <b>Helium Focused Ion Beam Milling of Two-Dimmensional Materials</b> (PDF available upon request) <br><br>

    California Institute of Technology <br>
    Mentor: Nai-Chang Yeh <br><br>
    
    Graphene is a monolayer of carbon atoms in a hexagonal lattice. This two-dimensional material has drawn much attention for its unique electrical properties and potential application in valleytronic devices. In order to electrically characterize graphene, it must be patterned into the Hall bar geometry. This project optimized parameters to mill graphene with a helium focused ion beam. After encountering extensive substrate swelling at beam doses required to mill through graphene, the sample was tilted to investigate the effect of varying incident beam angles. Oblique incident angles decreased swelling and produced narrower, deeper cuts. Tilt also decreased the required milling dose, reducing milling times. The optimal beam parameters were 10 kV accelerating voltage, 10 pA current, 25&#176; substrate tilt, 10 s beam dwell time, 2 nm beam step size, and 35 pC/&mu;m dose. The resulting channels were about 8 nm deep and 100-200 nm wide, electrically isolating the Hall bar shape from the surrounding graphene. Simulations performed with EnvizION software will elucidate the mechanism behind improved milling efficiency and reduced swelling at oblique angles. Hall bar devices were fabricated in graphene over strain-generating nanostructures and will be electrically characterized with a physical property measurement system (PPMS). <br><br>

    <b>Characterization of Multiferroic Thin Films Generated with Molecular Beam Epitaxy</b> (PDF available upon Request) <br><br>

    Cornell University <br>
    Mentor: Darrell Schlom <br><br>

    Magnetoelectric multiferroic thin films exhibit coupled ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. Interest in these multiferroics stems from their potential applications in spin-based computing and novel information storage methods. Through charac- terization with x-ray diffraction (XRD), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM), the growth of multiferroic films with molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) was optimized. Both strain-coupled Fe<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>composites and rare earth ferrite superlattices were studied. Additionally, this study searched for compatible bottom electrodes that facilitate the measurement of the ferroelectric properties of the films. Because the electrodes are necessarily located between the substrate and the film, all three must have compatible crystal lattice parameters in order to grow successfully with MBE. Characterization of the electrodes with XRD omega rocking curves and AFM revealed that PIN-PMN-PT produced slightly better iridium electrodes and Fe<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub> films than PMN-PT.
